# FreeRTOS-Final-Assignment

Simple FreeRTOS application made as a final assigment to real-time programming course. The code isn't pretty at the moment, since there's a lot of fixes to be made, but once the functions are deemed to work, the code will be cleaned. For now, it's really messy - it was initialized here just to get some sort of version control in case something goes wrong :)
